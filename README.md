# quarkus-simple-config
This is the manifest description and configuration of the [quarkus-simple](https://github.com/rafaeltuelho/quarkus-simple) application. It contains descriptions to create an ArgoApp and it contains the actual application manifest files for the Quarkus-Simple App in stages dev, stage and prod.

- `argo/`: Contains all the manifest files to create ArgoCD applications
- `config/`: Contains all the Kustomized manifests for the actual application itself
